##Introduction:
It's a java library dedicated to monitor the filesystem
It's aimed to record the directory for future use

##Version-Notes:
This new version has greatly improved the reliablity of the file-system by the use of __Info__ and __Severe__ Exceptions
Reliabliy speaking, Info level exceptions can be ignored.
But Severe level exceptions means something quite different: the __Consistency__ of the filesystem is damaged.
When Severe level exceptions happened, you may not be able to do anything about it.

##Notes && Knowledges:
None yet

##Notes from Author:
It's quite hard to write a filesystem library actually, harder than you thought.

I'm getting an Alienware 15 r2 and a razer Mamba chroma in the new year.
And Oculus sold out yesterday.
Hope you guys can get one in the new year.
